This software is provided "as is". Some bugs could be present.

modifications to be implemented. 

To run this application, you must :

1. Compile both server and client.
2. Have a mysql server installed on the server/computer who is hosting
the server part.
3. Run the sql script to create and configure the database needed for
the history.
4. Run the server: "java -jar server.jar"
5. The clients must have java installed to run the client part.
6. They must run "java -jar client.jar".
